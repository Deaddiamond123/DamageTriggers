# Damage triggers
uhh yeah very original name. 

Damage triggers is a basic plugin that adds the possibility for the user to damage people within a TriggerBox/TriggerSphere.
So you can barely edit things, like the List name if you know how to change it, the enter/exit events name, the damage it causes to the player and in how many seconds it will damage the user that is inside the Trigger. 

Everything has a few comments that will tell you what you can modify and how.
Enjoy
